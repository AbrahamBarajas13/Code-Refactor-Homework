# Code-Refactor-Homework
The project was mostly to understand what each element in css is doing. Described what each css element was doing and organized it so that it is easier to understand what each element is doing. Edit the html and css a bit so some of the containers are easier to see and adjust better to the other containers around them. Overall, the project helped me understand what elements affect certain aspects of the website along with changing the order around for easier understanding what certain codes affect within their parameters.
